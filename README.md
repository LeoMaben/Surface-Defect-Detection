# Surface Defect Detection using CNNs

This project explores and compares deep learning techniques for **binary classification of defective vs. non-defective 
materials** in grayscale surface images. It aims to deepen my understanding of CNN architectures, model performance
evaluation, and explainability using tools like **Grad-CAM**.

## Project Objectives

- Build a robust image classification pipeline for defect detection
- Explore and compare different CNN architectures
- Apply data augmentation and preprocessing best practices
- Understand model behavior through Grad-CAM explainability
- Automate model evaluation using key metrics
- Package project in a clean, modular way for reproducibility and future expansion

## 🗺️ Roadmap

### Phase 1: Data & Preprocessing
- [x] Load and resize images from source folders
- [x] Assign binary labels (defect / ok)
- [x] Perform stratified train-test split
- [x] Apply data augmentation (horizontal flip, rotation, contrast, etc.)
- [x] Normalize and batch the data using a `tf.data.Dataset` pipeline

### Phase 2: Modeling
- [x] Build multiple CNN models from scratch:
  - **LeNet-inspired model** (2 conv layers)
  - **Custom ResNet architecture**
  - **AlexNet architecture**
- [x] Train each model
- [x] Apply EarlyStopping and regularization (Dropout, L2, BatchNorm)

### Phase 3: Evaluation
- [x] Evaluate test set accuracy, loss
- [x] Generate:
  - Confusion matrix
  - Precision, recall, F1-score
  - ROC curve
- [x] Automate comparisons across models

### ✅ Phase 4: Explainability
- [x] Use **Grad-CAM** to visualize decision-making of CNNs
- [x] Overlay heatmaps on sample defect images for inspection
