# Surface-Defect-Detection

The goal of this project is to test out the various methods for defect detection.
Main goal is to further my understanding of how the inner working of these models function

## Roadmap/Plan: 
- Load and resize the data
- Perform data augmentation to have more training and testing samples 
- Split the data into train, test and hold-out set 
- Perform dimensionality reduction on the dataset used for supervised-learning models 
- Fit Logistic Regression, Decision Trees and XGBoost models 
- Create 3 different CNN models:
  - A simple model with only two convolutions emulating the architecture of LeNet 
  - A VGG-like model with 4 convolutional layers using (3,3) kernels 
  - A VGG16 model using the architecture available on Keras 
- Compare the results 
- One final attempt at creating a better model 
- Key insights and next steps
